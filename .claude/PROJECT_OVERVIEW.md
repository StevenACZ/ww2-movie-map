# WW2 Map Films - Project Overview

## Vision

WW2 Map Films is an interactive web application that allows users to explore World War II films through an immersive 2D map with a videogame aesthetic reminiscent of strategy games like Hearts of Iron 4 and Victoria 2. Users can navigate the map, visualize film locations, and access detailed information about each movie, creating a unique educational and entertainment experience.

## Main Objectives

1. **Interactive 2D Map**: Create a navigable map with dark/grey WW2 aesthetic theme
2. **Keyboard & Mouse Navigation**: Support WASD keys and mouse controls for intuitive exploration
3. **Film Visualization**: Display movie posters at the locations where events occurred
4. **Timeline Integration**: Implement a timeline slider (1936-1945) to filter films by year
5. **Location Highlighting**: Color regions/cities where film events took place
6. **Multilingual Support**: Provide interface in English and Spanish
7. **Desktop-First Design**: Optimize for desktop with basic mobile support
